# Arming the vehicle
* PX4 has explicit states for powering (arming) the vehicle components:
  
  ###### - Disarmed: there is no power to motors or actuators (servos).
  ###### - Prearmed: Actuators and other non-dangerous electronics are powered.
  ###### - Armed: Vehicle is fully powered, including motor/propeller.
  
* It's necessary to disable the **Safety Switch** from parameters if no real safety switch is used, otherwise the arming would fail and the vehicle would not response to any action; to disable the safety switch:
###### select the parameters icon and change the value of **CBRK_IO_SAFETY** to 22027
