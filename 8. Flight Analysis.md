# Flight Log Analysis

* **PX4** provides an online tool called the [**Flight Review Tool**](https://logs.px4.io/)
* Such a tool is used for any flight with a microcontroller like **Pixhawk** (must insert an **SD card**)
* During the flight, the flight logs are saved into the SD card (**ULog** files) and into the GCS through Telemetry (**tlog** files)
* A **tlog** file is basically a video stream of the **GCS** during the flight
* A **ULog** file is what you should pass to the **Flight Review Tool** to analyze the flight
* It provides plots for analyzing the sensors performance (including IMU), and tracking the PID controller Performance
* It compares the tracked states (position, velocity, altitude, or rate **setpoints**) with the estimated states
![fig.1](https://docs.px4.io/master/assets/flight_log_analysis/flight_review/flight_modes.png)

      State setpoints are automatically determined during a flight, depending on the flight mission/mode
      State Estimates are provided by the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) of the PX4 flight stack
      The estimated line (red) should closely match with the setpoint (green)
      If not, then PID gains of the controller needs to be tuned.
      Background color on the body of the plot indicates flight mode.
      
* The Flight Review Tool is also good for recognizing sensor noises and vibration, some noises may be acceptable and others may not:
#### Example (Good Vibration)

#### Example (Bad Vibration)
![fig.3](https://docs.px4.io/master/assets/flight_log_analysis/flight_review/vibrations_landing_gear_actuator_controls_fft.png)

      One reason may cause for bad sensor vibration is that the microcontroller isn't mounted very well, free from vibration,
      and on a save place far enough from the motor (which makes high vibrations).
      
* [**Vibration Isolation**](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/assembly/vibration_isolation.html) explains some basic things you can check (and do) to reduce vibration levels.
