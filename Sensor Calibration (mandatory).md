          Some calibrations would need a connection to the vehicle via USB and not the telemetry. 
          You'd not necessarily need to wire all the components or to mount the Pixhawk inside the Vehicle.
          You can start the calibration by selecting the gear button and choose the sensor to calibrate as follows.
