** Notes: 
##### Some calibrations would need a connection to the vehicle via USB and not the telemetry.
##### You'd not necessarily need to wire all the components or to mount the Pixhawk inside the Vehicle.
##### You can start the calibration by selecting the gear button and choose the sensor to calibrate as follows.
