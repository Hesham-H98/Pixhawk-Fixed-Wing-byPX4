       This sensor is not mandatory but it's preferable to encounter stall issues and to track the airspeed for more accurate analysis
       To skip the sensor calibration you have to change the parameter CBRK_AIRSPD_CHK (in QGC) from the value 0 to 162128

# Airspeed Sensor Calibration
* Select the gear icon > Sensors > Airspeed to calibrate
* You must cup the pitot tube with hand to prevent any reading errors caused by wind
* Press OK and follow the instructions in the command window
* You'd have to blow into the tip of the tube to read a desired value of pressure and the calibration then is complete

# Error encountered:
       [Call] Airspeed sensor not found
This kind of errors have many points of view and many possible causes
### 1. The Pixhawk has an older bootloader so it only loads the V2 firmware instead of the V3 (V2 might remove some drivers)

**** The solution to this is to check the firmware version, and load the V3 manually if not exists [Download PX4 V3](http://px4-travis.s3.amazonaws.com/Firmware/stable/px4fmu-v3_default.px4)

### 2. One common error is that the Pixhawk wiring to airspeed sensor isn't correct

**** You have to check back the wiring and pinout schematics (In our case the pinouts to I2C port wasn't right, we had to remove two pins and place them correctly).
